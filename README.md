## Preconditions

To ensure the test runs smoothly, the following conditions must be met:

### **User Account Constraints**
- The email used for registration must be **unique** to avoid conflicts.
- The password must meet website **security requirements** (e.g., minimum length, special characters, etc.).

### **Test Data Availability**
- If specific test data is required (e.g., **predefined names or email**), make sure they are accessible (either **hard-coded or generated**).

### **Test Dependencies**
- This test assumes that **registration functionality** and the **product catalog** are operational.
- No dependencies on other test cases, as this is a **self-contained end-to-end workflow**.
- If a test run fails, it should be able to **start fresh** without external setup.

## Post-Conditions
- In this specific test, there is no necessity to clear browsering data at the end of each test run.
- Each test is executed in isolation, with a new user session created for every individual test.
- As the state of one user does not impact the subsequent test, clearing browsering data is not required.
- If the main test involved multiple tests with dependencies between them, the management would be handled manually.
